# -International-Education-Cost-Analysis

This project explores the total cost of studying abroad by analyzing a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle. The analysis was conducted as part of a learning simulation at Vephla University, focusing on helping prospective students, consultants, and educational institutions understand the true financial burden of international education.

## Project Objective

To evaluate and compare the total cost of international education—beyond tuition—by analyzing rent, insurance, visa fees, living cost index, and exchange rates across 71 countries. The goal is to generate insights that support better planning, affordability strategies, and informed decision-making.

## Data Overview

Independent Variables: Country, City, University, Program, Level, Duration (Years), Living Cost Index, Rent (USD), Visa Fee (USD), Insurance (USD), Exchange Rate

Dependent Variables: Tuition (USD), Total Rent, Total Living Cost, Total Estimated Cost, Cost Per Year, Average Tuition, Average Total Cost, Max Cost, Total Tuition

## Industry Focus

The project sits at the intersection of International Education and Student Mobility, serving the needs of students, academic institutions, educational consultants, and financial planners.

## Key Insights

Computer Science programs had the highest tuition overall at $7.9M.

Aerospace Engineering was identified as the most expensive program.

Tunisia emerged as the least expensive country for international study.

The UK was the top destination for international students.

Master’s programs were most common, but costs were nearly evenly split across Bachelor, Master, and PhD programs (each over $300M).

Singapore had the highest rent, while Seattle was the lowest among the top cities.

The USA and UK accounted for the majority of insurance costs.

Iran reported the highest estimated total cost by country at approximately $0.36 billion.

## Final Recommendations
Evaluate the value vs. cost of high-tuition programs like Computer Science.

Expand support for students in high-rent cities through accommodation strategies.

Use the cost balance across levels to inform program development and funding.

Explore why Tunisia is cost-effective and why the UK attracts the most international students.

Investigate the true drivers of total cost in high-expense countries like Iran and Indonesia.
